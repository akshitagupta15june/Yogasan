### Motivation
Due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, many people are avoiding gathering in large groups, including yoga studios and other fitness spaces. I believe that stressful times
like these are precisely when people need wellness practices the most, and I am committed to doing my part to help out.
So here is the Yogasan app in progress.

With this initiative, I hope to encourage people to keep up their wellness routines as they choose to avoid physical workout spaces and stay healthy and safe in these uncertain times.
### Overview
My project involved me to get familiar with the Android Development environment and thus develop an application to serve as a personal companion yoga partner to one. I basically focussed on the yoga poses and timer
part, somehow, I utilized it to develop a yoga-trainer cum timer app. So, what my app does is fairly simple, you enter this app without any permissions requested, you want tobe sure that you have spent some time involving yourself
in asanas and after few minutes you will be rejuvenated.I have also implemented a countdown timer in my app in case one wants to be reminded at a certain time, pretty much like alarms during doing yoga.
That the functionality part, now for the part, I focussed my efforts to build an intuitive, clean and simple UI. For the same, I encompassed card UI in my app. These beautiful cards, originally inspired from google now, makes the saved notes look aesthetically pleasing. Then thereâ€™s the drag and
drop feature, a cool way to launch activities in the app by dropping those over a specified region called Launch pad. I also implemented swipe able tabs so as to provide ease in
navigating between different yoga poses.

### Approach
I approached this project to learn about the android development environment not merely to sneak the code from tutorials and copy-paste to build something. With this in mind, first I developed a lot of apps which
implements different aspects of android ability and which were, totally unrelated to our project. Among those were a primitive calculator, username-password authentication window, Splash screen music player, a primitive camera app and others Now, after getting pretty much exposure in android development, we decided to go ahead with our project app. Ignoring the futile attempts to add many features in our app, which unfortunately could not be
made possible, the work of our final app can be divided into the following phases:
Card UI

Drag and Drop

Swipe able Tabs

Colour Coding

Different yoga poses

Steps of doing particular pose

Timer

Card UI:
I had to display the views in some simple, yet beautiful manner. Text view as out of the way for being way too simple. I explored the internet for the same. At last, inspired
from Google now cards, I decided to implement those cards in our app.

Swipe able Tabs:
I have added swipe able tabs to be navigate to and from the yoga poses. These are nowadays found in many applications supporting the Android 4.x framework. Just a flick of a finger and you move on to the other screen. Implementation of the same seemed easy at first, but proved to be a time-
taking and tough task.

Remaining tasks

A better UI/UX high definition screen view.

Addition of unlimited yoga poses

Addition of some benefits of every yoga pose

Reminders if not done yoga a single day.

Furthermore implementations.

With this initiative, I hope to encourage people to keep up
their wellness routines as they choose to avoid physical
workout spaces and stay healthy and safe in these uncertain
times.

This app I made solely for the purpose to promote yoga more because it is the most essential part of human beings. The app is not completed but hope so I will complete this app in 2 more weeks.
I made this app for My Gov Innovation just two days before so it will need some more efforts from my side.
