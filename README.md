# YOGASAN

## Inspiration

Due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, many people are avoiding gathering in large groups, including yoga studios and other fitness spaces. I believe that stressful times like these are precisely when people need wellness practices the most, and I am committed to doing my part to help out. So here is the Yogasan app.

With this initiative, I hope to encourage people to keep up their wellness routines as they choose to avoid physical workout spaces and stay healthy and safe in these uncertain times.

## What it does

My project involved me getting familiar with the Android Development environment and thus develop an application to serve as a personal companion yoga partner to one. I basically focussed on the yoga poses and timer part, somehow, I utilized it to develop a yoga-trainer cum timer app. So, what my app does is fairly simple, you enter this app without any permissions requested, you want to be sure that you have spent some time involving yourself in asanas and after few minutes you will be rejuvenated. I have also implemented a countdown timer in my app in case one wants to be reminded at a certain time, pretty much like alarms during doing yoga. That the functionality part, now for the part, I focussed my efforts to build an intuitive, clean and simple UI. For the same, I encompassed card UI in my app. These beautiful cards, originally inspired by google now, makes the saved notes look aesthetically pleasing. Then thereâ€™s the drag and drop feature, a cool way to launch activities in the app by dropping those over a specified region called Launchpad. I also implemented swipe-able tabs so as to provide ease in navigating between different yoga poses.

## How we built it

I approached this project to learn about the android development environment not merely to sneak the code from tutorials and copy-paste to build something. With this in mind, first I developed a lot of apps that implement different aspects of android ability and which were, totally unrelated to our project. Among those were a primitive calculator, username-password authentication window, Splash screen music player, a primitive camera app, and others Now, after getting pretty much exposure in android development, we decided to go ahead with our project app. The work of our final app can be divided into the following phases: Card UI

Drag and Drop

Swipeable Tabs

Colour Coding

Different yoga poses

Steps of doing a particular pose

Timer

Card UI: I had to display the views in some simple, yet beautiful manner. Text view as out of the way for being way too simple. I explored the internet for the same. At last, inspired by Google now cards, I decided to implement those cards in our app.

Swipeable Tabs: I have added swipeable tabs to navigate to and from the yoga poses. These are nowadays found in many applications supporting the Android 4.x framework. Just a flick of a finger and you move on to the other screen. Implementation of the same seemed easy at first but proved to be a time- taking and tough task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we have built something which will be beneficial for society.

## What we learned

Android Development and also various Yoga Poses while making this application.

## What's next for YOGASAN

With this initiative, I hope to encourage people to keep up their wellness routines as they choose to avoid physical workout spaces and stay healthy and safe in these uncertain times. This app I made solely for the purpose to promote yoga more because it is the most essential part of human beings. 


Remaining tasks

Addition of unlimited yoga poses

Addition of some benefits of every yoga pose

Reminders if not done yoga a single day.
